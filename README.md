# Future Skill Mapper

**Industry:** Education / EdTech / Future of Work  
**Project Type:** AI Product Prototype  
Building one AI app per day using vibe-coding , focused on one industry problem at a time.

## Overview

Future Skill Mapper is an interactive AI-powered application designed to help schools, parents, and students map today’s curriculum to future-ready skills projected to be essential by 2030.

The goal is to bridge the gap between traditional education and emerging workforce demands through structured analysis and actionable recommendations.

---

## The Problem

Many school curricula still emphasize skills that may not align with future workforce needs.

As industries evolve due to AI, automation, and digital transformation, students risk learning outdated skills that may not prepare them for 2030 and beyond.

There is currently no simple, structured system that helps:

- Schools evaluate curriculum relevance  
- Parents understand future skill alignment  
- Kids visualize how their learning connects to real-world opportunities  

---

## The Solution

Future Skill Mapper analyzes current curriculum topics and maps them to projected 2030 skill categories using structured evaluation logic.

The app provides:

- Curriculum-to-skill mapping  
- 2030 future skill categorization  
- Relevance scoring  
- Alignment gap detection  
- Actionable upgrade recommendations  

---

## Core Features

### 1. Curriculum Analysis Engine
- Accepts subject topics or syllabus input  
- Breaks curriculum into structured skill components  

### 2. 2030 Skill Mapping
- Maps topics to future-focused skill categories:
  - Critical thinking  
  - AI literacy  
  - Digital fluency  
  - Adaptability  
  - Collaboration  
  - Creativity  
  - Problem solving  

### 3. Relevance Scoring
- Generates a relevance score (0–100)  
- Identifies outdated, neutral, or future-aligned areas  

### 4. Gap Detection
- Highlights missing future skills  
- Detects overemphasis on declining skill areas  

### 5. Actionable Recommendations
- Suggests curriculum upgrades  
- Recommends project-based integrations  
- Provides parent-friendly explanations

## Why This Requires a Purpose-Built App

Future-skill alignment requires:

- Structured curriculum breakdown  
- Standardized skill categorization  
- Consistent mapping logic  
- Repeatable evaluation workflows  

Conversational AI can give advice, but it cannot maintain structured curriculum-to-skill alignment frameworks across multiple subjects and users.

This system transforms abstract future-skill discussions into measurable, structured evaluation.

## Target Audience

- Schools reviewing curriculum relevance  
- Educators planning future-ready lesson design  
- Parents evaluating academic preparedness  
- Students exploring skill-based growth  

---

## Prompt Used

> Begin with a concise checklist outlining the approach to analyzing and mapping current school curriculum to skills projected to be essential in 2030.  
> Assess curriculum relevance and generate actionable recommendations for alignment.  
> After mapping, validate that recommendations are logically consistent and adjust if inconsistencies or gaps are identified.
